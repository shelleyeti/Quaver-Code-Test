# New Hire Code Test
This coding challenge will be sent to potential new hires to test their debugging skills. 

# What the project does
* Uses the Github API to pull top repos.
* Loops through the top repos and grab the URLs.
* Encrypts the URLs and stores them in a text file, only if that URL does not already exist (no duplicates).
* The Github API will be called three times. In the View you will see a boolean if the text file contains any duplicates for the three API calls.

# What you need to do
* This program is broken in several places. Step through and find where the program is broken.
* The expected result is all three API call duplicate checks return false.

Remember there should be no duplicates of any URLs in the text file!

# How to deliver 
* Clone down the solution and copy the QuaverCodeChallenge folder into your own GitHub repo.
* Send us the link (email implementation@QuaverMusic.com) to your GitHub solution when complete.
